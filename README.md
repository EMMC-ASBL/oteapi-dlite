# OTEAPI DLite Plugin

All strategies implemented in this plugin (except for `create_collection`) assumes that you have the UUID of a DLite collection with the key `collection_id` in the `session`:

```python
collection_id = session["collection_id"]
coll = dlite.get_collection(collection_id)
```

A DLite collection stores references to DLite instances and relations between them as RDF triples.
Hence, the collection is a knowledge base for the current use case.

In order to make it easy retrieve the collection id when executing a pipeline, the `get()` method of all filters in this plugin should return the `collection_id`.
